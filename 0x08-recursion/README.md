0x08 Recursion

Description
In this project, we explore the concept of recursion in programming.
Recursion is a powerful technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.
It's widely used in various algorithms and data structures,
and it's essential for understanding computer science and programming at a deeper level.

Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of recursion and when to use it.
- Implement recursive solutions to problems.
- Compare and contrast recursion with iterative approaches.
- Solve problems using recursion in C programming.

Requirements
- All code is written in C.
- C standard library functions are not used.
- Code is compiled using gcc 4.8.4 with the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic.
