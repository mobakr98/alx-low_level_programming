0x0E. C - Structures, typedef

Description
In this project, we explore the concept of structures and typedef in the C programming language.
We learn how to define and use structures to create custom data types,
organize data, and improve code readability.
Additionally, we discover the power of typedef to create aliases for existing data types,
making our code more self-explanatory.
