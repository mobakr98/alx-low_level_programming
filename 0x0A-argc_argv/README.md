0x0A. C - argc, argv


Description
This repository contains a collection of C programs that demonstrate the use
of the argc and argv parameters in C.
In C programming, these parameters are used to pass command-line arguments to a program,
allowing it to take input from the command line when it is executed.


The programs in this repository cover various aspects of working with argc and argv, including:
- Parsing command-line arguments
- Validating input arguments
- Using command-line flags and options
- Performing different actions based on input arguments
- Handling error cases


Getting Started
To compile and run these programs,
you will need a C compiler such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your system.


Follow these steps to get started:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/mobakr98/0x0A-argc-argv.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd 0x0A-argc-argv

3. Compile the C programs using GCC. For example, to compile a program named my_program.c:
gcc -o my_program my_program.c

4. Run the compiled program, passing command-line arguments as needed:
./my_program arg1 arg2 arg3
