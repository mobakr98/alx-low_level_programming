alx-low_level_programming
Welcome to the alx-low_level_programming repository! This repository is dedicated to the first project of the ALX Software Engineering program's low-level programming module. In this project, we will be focusing on the basics of C programming, including variables, if statements, else statements, and while loops.

Project Overview
This project, 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while, is designed to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of C programming. You will learn about:

Variables: How to declare and initialize variables, understanding their data types and their roles in programming.
Conditional Statements: Using if and else statements to create decision-making structures in your code.
Loops: Implementing while loops to execute code repeatedly based on specific conditions.
By completing this project, you will gain a strong foundation in C programming that will be crucial for your journey into more advanced topics.

Repository Structure
The repository is structured to help you easily navigate through the project materials and your own code submissions. Here's an overview of the main folders and files you'll find:

0x01-variables_if_else_while: This is the main project directory containing all the source code files for the project.

0-positive_or_negative.c: A C program that determines if a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.
1-last_digit.c: A C program that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number and checks if it's greater than 5, less than 6 but not 0, or 0.
2-print_alphabet.c: A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase.
3-print_alphabets.c: A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by uppercase.
4-print_alphabt.c: A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase except for 'q' and 'e'.
5-print_numbers.c: A C program that prints all single-digit numbers.
6-print_numberz.c: A C program that prints all single-digit numbers without using char data type.
7-print_tebahpla.c: A C program that prints the alphabet in reverse.
8-print_base16.c: A C program that prints all the hexadecimal digits.
9-print_comb.c: A C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
10-print_comb2.c: A C program that prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers.
README.md: You are here! This is the README file that provides an overview of the project and repository.

Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/mobakr98/alx-low_level_programming.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd alx-low_level_programming/0x01-variables_if_else_while
Explore the individual C program files and their contents.

Compile and run the C programs using a C compiler (e.g., gcc). For example:

Copy code
gcc -o 0-positive_or_negative 0-positive_or_negative.c
./0-positive_or_negative
