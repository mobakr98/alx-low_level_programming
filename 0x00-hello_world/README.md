Introduction
C is a powerful programming language known for its efficiency, versatility, and close-to-hardware capabilities. This project is designed to help you understand the basic structure of a C program, learn about the compilation process, and get started with writing and running simple C programs.

Project Goals
The main goals of this project are:

Introduction to C: Familiarize yourself with the syntax and structure of the C programming language.

"Hello, World!" Program: Write a basic "Hello, World!" program in C to understand the fundamental components of a C program.

Compilation and Execution: Learn how to compile and run a C program using a compiler.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this project repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x00-hello-world.git
Navigate to Project Directory: Change your working directory to the project directory.

cd 0x00-hello-world
Files
The project directory contains the following files:

0-hello_world.c: This is the main source code file that contains the "Hello, World!" program written in C.
How to Compile and Run
Follow these steps to compile and run the "Hello, World!" program:

Compile: Open your terminal and run the following command to compile the program.

gcc -o hello_world 0-hello_world.c
This command uses the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) to compile the source code and generate an executable named hello_world.

Run: After successful compilation, run the compiled executable.

./hello_world
You should see the output "Hello, World!" printed to the terminal.
