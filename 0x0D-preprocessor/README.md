0x0D. C - Preprocessor

Description
In this project, we will explore the C preprocessor, a powerful tool for manipulating C code
before it is compiled. We will learn about macros, conditional
compilation, include guards, and other preprocessor directives
that help us write more flexible and efficient C code.
